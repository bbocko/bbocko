# 👋 Hi, I'm Blaž

🔭 I’m a self-taught developer passionate about web development. I started my journey last year, learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Since then, I've expanded my skills to include basics of React and Node.js, and I'm currently focused on mastering TypeScript and Angular.
